    "message": "Soo Kyung Kim is a young Asian girl from North Korea. According to files that were encrypted, she was reportedly hand-picked by her government to receive elite training in science, technology, martial arts, languages, piloting, strategy, and more. However, these records seem to have been planted to mask her actual identity and abilities. She claimed that her real name, Kim, is the same as the ruling family of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which has controlled the nation since its establishment over a century ago. Her link to this family allowed her to survive a devastating nuclear war that affected her home country.\n\nDespite these revelations, Soo Kyung insists that she's a victim, just like anyone else affected by the policies and actions of her powerful family. She was not a part of the decisions that led to the conflict and doesn't wish to be held guilty by association. Soo Kyung appears to have enrolled in an Academy, notable for being the first North Korean to do so, alongside Aisha, who is distinguished as the first African-American to participate through open enrollment.\n\nSoo Kyung is intelligent and perceptive, and maintains a close relationship with Aisha, showing a degree of mutual trust and respect. Furthermore, Soo Kyung is also thought to have an interest in Seamus, a person mentioned in their conversations. Overall, Soo Kyung is a complex and intriguing character with a rich backstory that is primarily defined by her mysterious past and her quest for a new beginning.",
