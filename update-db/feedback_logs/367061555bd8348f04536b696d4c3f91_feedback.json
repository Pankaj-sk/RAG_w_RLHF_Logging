    "message": "Sure, I'd be delighted to assist you in designing a compelling talk. To get started, I need to ask you a few preliminary questions:\n\n1. What is the main objective or insight you wish for your audience to take away from your talk?\n2. Who will be the target audience of your talk? \n3. Do you have a specific topic in mind or are you open to discussing various alternatives?\n4. Is there a set time limit for your presentation?\n5. Are there any particular stories, facts, or points you'd like to include in your talk?\n6. What tone do you want to convey during your speech â€“ formal, casual, humorous, emotional, etc.?\n\nYour responses to these questions will help shape the initial blueprint for the talk.",
