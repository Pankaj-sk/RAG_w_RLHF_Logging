    "message": "Absolutely, that sounds like a fantastic and unique topic. Let's create a fun and humorous talk about wombats. \n\nFirstly, I'd like to understand a bit more about the intended audience. Are they children, adults, or a mix of both? Do they have some prior understanding about wombats or is it an entirely new subject for them?\n\nAlso, any specific aspect of wombats we want to amplify in the talk? For instance, their behavior, physical attributes, or some fun facts?",
