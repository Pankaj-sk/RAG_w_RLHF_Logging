    "message": "I'm sorry for the confusion but I'm an AI language model developed by OpenAI. I can certainly help frame the structure of your presentation based on your responses, but I'm unable to provide firsthand opinions or responses as I don't have personal experiences or perspectives.\n\nIf you share more details based on your own understanding, I'd be more than happy to assist you in organizing those details into an engaging talk. It would be helpful if you could share your insights about Soo-Kyung Kim from 'Space Cadets' and the points you'd like to bring up about her character or her relevance to your topic. Additionally, knowing your intended audience and the length of your presentation would be great.",
