Soo -Kyung only smiled more.  \n“It’s okay, ” she said. “ Your secret is safe with me.”  \n“I’m not so sure it ’s a secret anymore,” Aisha replied, quietly.  \n“You are bigger than I,” said Soo -Kyung, “and stronger. I would \nhave no hope against you in close combat -- if it were just a question \nof mass. ” \nThere was something about the way Soo -Kyung moved, a \nconfidence and litheness  about her that Aisha hadn ’t noticed before.  \n“Okay, ” she said, grabbing the front of Aisha ’s uniform. She \ntwisted her wrists, bent her knees and turned at the hip. Suddenly \nAisha felt herself being flung to the ground. The smaller girl had \nthrown her like she was a toy. She had done it with enough control \nso that Aisha didn ’t get hurt.  \nSoo-Kyung laughed a little, and reached out a hand to pick \nAisha up.  \n“It’s just physics, ” she said. “ It’s the concept of a lever. These \nallow you to exert a large force over distance by applying a small \nforce at the right place. My arms are the levers.”  \nSoo-Kyung twisted her hips like earlier. “ So when I twist my hips \nlike this, I can turn your own weight against you. Now, you try. ” \n“But I ’m bigger than you. ” \n“It doesn ’t matter. You aren ’t strong enough to pick me up and \nthrow me, are you? ” \nAisha shrugged. Gripping Soo -Kyung the same way she had \nbeen gripped, she twisted her wrists and turned from the hips in the \nsame way. Nothing happened.\n\n2. But until then?  \nHow she has bonded with David, Soo -Kyung and Seamus is \nthe perfect team. Let ’s keep them together for the time being.  \n \nIT NEVER FAILED  to give her a rush when she saw the moonscape \nzoom below, and the blue curve of Earth rise above it. Aisha smiled \nat its beauty.  \nDown there, girls her age were wondering about homecoming \ndances, and what dress they ’d wear, or which boy would ask them \nout. She was much happier here, piloting her ship, zooming at \nbreakneck speeds across the moon, and getting ready to break into \ndeep space.  \n“I think I see them, ” said David, navigator and co -pilot sitting in one of \nthe wing pods to her right. “Two -seven -zero karem one -nine-eight. ” \n“Confirmed,” came the clipped voice of Soo -Kyung, her gunner. \nAisha glanced to the pod on her left and her eyes met Soo -Kyung ’s. \nThe Korean girl smiled and nodded.  140 Laurence Moroney   \nAisha always wanted a visual confirmation. Comm lines could \nbe hacked and voices faked. Soo -Kyung knew this instinctively. \nThat’s what made them a great team.  \n“Okay, ” said Aisha. “ Weapons hot. Let ’s check them out. ” \nShe punched in the coordinates, and the ship turned towards \ntheir target.  \n“Visual range in five seconds, ” said David.  \n“I see them,” Aisha replied. Her heads -up display started to light \nup with targets, squares projected on her canopy, wrapping tiny dots \nthat could easily be mistaken for stars to the naked eye.\n\n3. ***\nAs they left, she felt Soo -Kyung link her arm. There wasn ’t much to \nsay. They walked back to their apartment, and sat, sipping coffee as \nthe Earth rotated into view across the windows. \n“Three years, ” said Soo -Kyung.  \n“Three years,” repeated Aisha.  \nSoo-Kyung ’s intense gaze returned. “ We’re going to do this. \nWe’re going to succeed, and we’ re going to save them all. ” \n“Not all of them, ” said Aisha sadly. “ But as many as we can. ” \nThe Earth continued to rotate across her view. She saw the great \nfrozen north of Canada, and realized that Patrice was down there. \nSophie was down there.  \nI’m here she thought, and someday soon I will be down there with \nyou. We will be together, and we will build the world we dreamed of. \nWe will build a new future for man kind. A future in the stars.  \nShe reached her hand up and touched the glass, watching the \nEarth beneath.  \nI promise.\n\n4. “Yes!” Aisha reached towards Soo -Kyung, and rested her hand \non her shoulder. “ And, no, ” she said, knowing that she needed to be \nhonest with Soo -Kyung. “There was something more.”  \n“What? ” \nAisha told her about her own file. That it had been sealed and \nencrypted so deeply that Seamus couldn ’t break it.  \n“Yet he was able to break mine? ” \n“Yes.” \n“Curious, ” Soo -Kyung said . \n“So what did he read? ” \n“Probably the cover story.”  \n“Cover story? ” Aisha asked . \n“I’m not exactly what I appear to be. ” \n“He said that nobody  here is exactly who they appear to be.”  \n“He is very wise,” she smiled a little. “ And cute. ” \nAisha wasn ’t going to let her change the subject. “Just who are \nyou, then? ” \n“According to the files, I ’m one of the children that were hand-\npicked by the regime in  my country to go through the best of \ntraining in everything. Science, technology, martial arts, languages, \npiloting, strategy…a list as long as your arm. ” \n“According to the files? ” \n“Yes. That was planted to explain how I can do the things I do, \nand to dis tract from the truth about who I am. ” \n“Who are you? ” \n“My name is Kim. ” \n“Yes. I know. It ’s a common name in Korea. ” \n“It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment. The family that had controlled the\n\n5. vertigo that those closer to the front would encounter. She picked one in the back row, next to an Asian girl who looked about Aisha ’s \nage. The girl was intensely reading a book on her tablet, and didn ’t \nlook up as Aisha sat.  \nShe suddenly spoke. “ Aisha Parks, celebrity. ” \nAisha looked at her. “ I’m not sure about that .” \nThe girl looked up, and her intense eyes searched Aisha ’s. “Good \nto know, ” she said finally, reaching a hand out. “ Soo-Kyung Kim, ” \nshe said.  \n“I don ’t need to tell you my name, I guess. ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled. Her plain face lit up when she smiled. She \nwas beautiful.  \n“So where are you from? ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled again. “You haven’ t heard of me? Good. I \nguess I am not a celebrity, either.”  \nSuch an odd an swer, and from Soo -Kyung ’s reaction, it was clear \nthat Aisha ’s confusion was written on her face.  26 Laurence Moroney  \n“I think we are going to be good friends, ” said Soo -Kyung. “I like how \nyou are straightforward. I am too, but that intimidates some people. ” \n“So where are you  from? ” \n“I am from a small village called Sijungho, ” continued Soo -\nKyung. “There’ s not much to see there.”  \n“Sounds Korean, ” said Aisha. “ You from South Korea? ” \n“North  Korea,” corrected Soo -Kyung. “I’ve never even been to \nSouth Korea. ” \nAisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a \nlittle, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat.
