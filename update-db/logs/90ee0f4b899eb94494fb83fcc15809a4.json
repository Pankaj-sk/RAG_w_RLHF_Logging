Simms regula rly called upon her to \ncommand groups of flyers against ones that he set up.  \nAt first, his teams won easily. But, over time, she began to see \nhow he thought, and how he did  things. That was his weakness -- his \npredictability.  \nThe first time she beat him, i t was a tough slog and narrow \nvictory. After that, the wins came easier and easier, until he didn ’t \nseem to be much of a challenge anymore. \nHer sessions with Patrice were also extremely rewarding. Not \nonly was she learning a lot about self -defense, she als o found herself \ngrowing in confidence as she understood the art better. She \nremembered the first day that Soo -Kyung had shown her basic \nthrows, and how the smaller girl had held herself. Now she felt more \ncomfortable in her stance. \nShe hadn’ t yet dared go into the mess hall, but she knew the day \nwas coming soon.  \nPatrice became more and more interesting every moment she \nspent with him. He was certainly a very masculine guy, but not the \ncliché musclebound moron that she ’d known around her old school. 86 Laurence Moroney   \nIt went beyond intelligence, too --  there was something deeply \ninsightful about him. When he began to share his hopes and dreams \nfor the future with her, she realized that she wanted to spend the rest \nof her life with him.\n\n2. “I don ’t even know your name.”  \nHe smiled. “ You’re right. Patrice.”  \n“Isn’t that a girl ’s name? ” \nHe laughed. “ Not in Canada, apparently! ” \nShe liked his natural laugh. There was something so sincere and \nunguarded about it.  \n“So what do you want to talk about? ” \n“I have been here for almost six years,” he said. “ Almost since the \nbeginning. There were only two wheels then.”  \n“You must have been, what, eleven? ” \n“Ten, ” he said. “ But my parents thought it was best for me to \ncome here.”  \n“That’s rough. You must miss them. ” \n“I do, and I don ’t,” he said. “ I rarely saw them when I was Earth -\nside, as I was always carted off to various boarding schools. I think I \nmiss my sister most of all. ” \n“I’m sorry, that must be hard,” said Aisha, putting her hand on \nhis arm gently for a moment.  \n“I guess I ’m used to it, ” he said. “ That’s the life of a  rich kid. ” \nAisha nodded. “ You were one of the first ones here, so I figured \nyou must be. ” \n“Not just rich, ” said Patrice. “ My family is one of the richest in the \nworld. They funded much of the development of this place.”  \nShe resisted the impulse to say ‘ wow’, and instead defiantly \nburst out, “ Am I supposed to be impressed? ” \n“I’m glad you aren ’t,” he said. “ Money is a fleeting thing after all. ” 52 Laurence Moroney   \n“So why are you telling me this? ” \nHe sat on a small bench, and she joined him. There was a \nwindow in the floor in f ront of them, and they watched as the Earth\n\n3. And just like that Aisha embraced him. Held him close.  \n“We will, ” she said. “ We’ll do it together.”  \n***  \nShe didn ’t know if it was because of their sch edules, or because they \nwere afraid of cover being blown, but she and Soo -Kyung didn ’t see \nmuch of Patrice or Seamus for the next few days. Maybe it was a good thing -- there was just so much to take in. The school was \nhitting them hard with science, mostl y physics, and mostly practical.  \nNot for the first time, she wondered why they spent so much \ntime in labs, when they were up in space. Mister Stevens, their lab \nmaster, had them working on experiments in understanding inertia \nand the transfer of force. Ais ha swore that if she bounced one more \nmetal ball off another steel block to measure the transfer of energy, she’d scream.  \nIt was relief when, at the end of class, their form master \nentered. He was a tall man with a craggy face who only wanted to be called Simms.  \n“Today, Cadets, we have a little surprise for you. We’ re going to \nthe hub, where you ’re going to get your first taste of being a real \ncadet. So take off your lab coats and safety glasses, and rank up behind me! ”  Space Cadets  59 \nThey followed him, in rank, up ladders through section after \nsection as they approached the hub. With a giddy feeling, Aisha felt \nherself get lighter and lighter as the gravity reduced. Finally, they entered through a hatch into a wide, empty area.\n\n4. ***\nAs they left, she felt Soo -Kyung link her arm. There wasn ’t much to \nsay. They walked back to their apartment, and sat, sipping coffee as \nthe Earth rotated into view across the windows. \n“Three years, ” said Soo -Kyung.  \n“Three years,” repeated Aisha.  \nSoo-Kyung ’s intense gaze returned. “ We’re going to do this. \nWe’re going to succeed, and we’ re going to save them all. ” \n“Not all of them, ” said Aisha sadly. “ But as many as we can. ” \nThe Earth continued to rotate across her view. She saw the great \nfrozen north of Canada, and realized that Patrice was down there. \nSophie was down there.  \nI’m here she thought, and someday soon I will be down there with \nyou. We will be together, and we will build the world we dreamed of. \nWe will build a new future for man kind. A future in the stars.  \nShe reached her hand up and touched the glass, watching the \nEarth beneath.  \nI promise.\n\n5. “But I ’m bigger than you. ” \n“It doesn ’t matter. You aren ’t strong enough to pick me up and \nthrow me, are you? ” \nAisha shrugged. Gripping Soo -Kyung the same way she had \nbeen gripped, she twisted her wrists and turned from the hips in the \nsame way. Nothing happened.  \nShe pulled harder, and lifted Soo -Kyung a little, but by turning \nshe lost balance and fell, pulling Soo -Kyung down on top of her.  \n“Am I interrupting something? ” \nThey turned to look at the source of the voice: Patrice.   Space Cadets  85 \nSoo-Kyung lifted herself off Aisha and nimbly jumped to her \nfeet. Patrice smiled and reached down. Aisha took his hand, and he \neffortlessly lifted her to her feet. \n“Nice effort,” he said. “ But you need to work on it. ” \nSo Aisha grabbed the lapels of his uniform, flicked her wrists \nand twisted at the hip. The expression of surpris e on his face as she \nthrew him to the ground was perfect. \n***  \nFor the next few weeks, life continued apace in the Academy, and things began to take on a feeling of normalcy. Aisha was even \nbeginning to enjoy her classes, especially the science and math ones, at which she excelled.  \nThe highlight of each week was when Simms took them flying. \nWhile others, such as Soo -Kyung and Ronaldo, were extremely \neffective flyers that Aisha could never hope to match, she did seem \nto have a knack for strategy. Simms regula rly called upon her to \ncommand groups of flyers against ones that he set up.\n\nMessage:\nTell me about Aisha and Patrice\n"

As we got older, and \nwe realized how special our relationship was, we realized that it was this thing that poets and writers a nd singers spend so much time \ndescribing. Yet none of them captured the true feelings that we had. \nNone of them could put a frame around what love actually is. ” \nHe stopped, and sat on a flattened boulder. “And then the Caliphate attacked Israel. She was on  a bus \nheaded back from school. I was at a meeting at my father ’s company, \nwhere they were telling us about the Academy, and my father was \npushing for them to take me. The first bombs fell, and the only \nmercy was that she was killed instantly. She didn ’t suffer.”  132 Laurence Moroney   \n“I’m sorry, ” was all she could muster. It didn ’t feel like \nnearly enough.  \n“I didn ’t want to come to the academy, ” he said. “ I didn ’t want to \nleave her, and there was no place for her here. My parents told me \nthat it was God ’s will for me to come. T hat everything, no matter \nhow tragic, was for His perfect will.”  \nShe put her hand on his shoulder, and even though they both \nwore thick padded spacesuits, she could feel him trembling. \n“So I came, ” he said. “ More to get away from them  than anything. \nThen I  learned about this program, and how we can go to the stars. I \nwant to go out there. And every day I ’m going to look for their so -\ncalled God, and his so -called Heaven.”\n\n2. her heart.  \nIs this what they cal l love,  she wondered, before Soo -Kyung \ninsisted that the boys stay for dinner.    \n \nCHAPTER 13  \nFriendship  \nLove can be such a powerful force, and such a fickle feeling. \nBefore you ever find love, you will wonder what it is, and \nthere are many emotions, many states of mind that you might \nconfuse with love.  \nDon’t fall for words of love. Words without actions to back \nthem up are meaningless. Don ’t be a fool for flattery.  \nDon’t fall for promises of love. Love is present in the here and \nnow. If  someone loves you, they love you now, not sometime \nin a nebulous future.  \nAbove all, don ’t fall for mere feelings of love, feelings come \nand go, and can be fooled.  \nYou’ll know when the time is right and the person is right. \nHe won ’t be one that you want to  be the one, he’ ll just ‘ be’ \nthe one.  \nLove is an action, and the ultimate action is sacrifice. When \nyou find the one that would lay his life down for you, and you \nwould lay yours down for him, you ’ll have found love...  \n \n“THEY ARE CALLED BLAC K BEAN  noodle s, and they are a comfort \nfood in Korea, ” said Soo -Kyung as Aisha tried to manipulate the \ninky, sticky mess onto a pair of chopsticks. Patrice was looking at his \nsuspiciously, but Seamus was slurping them down like a pro.   Space Cadets  83 \n“Well, South Korea anyway. We used to smuggle the packaged \nones across the border into my country. Cheap, nasty stuff, but\n\n3. to declare that you love him when you might not, because that \nwould possibly hurt him. And you never want to hurt someone \nyou love, right? ” \n“Can’t I just be compassionate? ” \n“Something tells me you ’re passionate. I ’m not sure about the \n‘com’ part! ” \nThey laughed, and hugged a little.  \nSoo- Kyung asked quietly. “ Patrice is like that a little bit too, \nisn’t he? ” 136 Laurence Moroney   \n“I think so, but, I can ’t tell for sure right now.”  \n“And how about you? ” \n“Like you, I think I love him, which probably means I do  love him. ” \n“I can see why. When Seamus talks about him, I see his eyes light \nup. They were really good friends, and he ’s hurting to see Patrice the \nway he is, but also proud of him for what he did. ” \n“Yeah, me too.”  \nThey sat in silence a while longer. \n“So,” said Aisha. “ I have a very important question for you.”  \n“Yeah? ” \n“Did he kiss you? ” \n“On our walk? ” \n“Yeah. You guys went off alone for a while. ” \n“We were wearing spacesuits. It ’s not exactly possible. ” \n“But did he try? ” \nHer only answer was a smack in the f ace from Soo -Kyung ’s \npillow, which despite the moon ’s lower gravity, still hit her with \nsome force.  \n***  \nThe return flight to the station was a quiet one. Most of them hadn ’t \nslept well with the lighter gravity, and Aisha and Soo -Kyung had spent \nmost of the  night alternating between talking and pillow fighting.  \nDavid was still quiet as they departed. He wistfully watched the\n\n4. But until then?  \nHow she has bonded with David, Soo -Kyung and Seamus is \nthe perfect team. Let ’s keep them together for the time being.  \n \nIT NEVER FAILED  to give her a rush when she saw the moonscape \nzoom below, and the blue curve of Earth rise above it. Aisha smiled \nat its beauty.  \nDown there, girls her age were wondering about homecoming \ndances, and what dress they ’d wear, or which boy would ask them \nout. She was much happier here, piloting her ship, zooming at \nbreakneck speeds across the moon, and getting ready to break into \ndeep space.  \n“I think I see them, ” said David, navigator and co -pilot sitting in one of \nthe wing pods to her right. “Two -seven -zero karem one -nine-eight. ” \n“Confirmed,” came the clipped voice of Soo -Kyung, her gunner. \nAisha glanced to the pod on her left and her eyes met Soo -Kyung ’s. \nThe Korean girl smiled and nodded.  140 Laurence Moroney   \nAisha always wanted a visual confirmation. Comm lines could \nbe hacked and voices faked. Soo -Kyung knew this instinctively. \nThat’s what made them a great team.  \n“Okay, ” said Aisha. “ Weapons hot. Let ’s check them out. ” \nShe punched in the coordinates, and the ship turned towards \ntheir target.  \n“Visual range in five seconds, ” said David.  \n“I see them,” Aisha replied. Her heads -up display started to light \nup with targets, squares projected on her canopy, wrapping tiny dots \nthat could easily be mistaken for stars to the naked eye.\n\n5. He put his hands up to stop her saying anything further. “ I \nunderstand that most guys might try something, so you might think \nthat’s what I meant, but I ’m not interested, and I never will be.”  \nEven though she knew what he meant, the words still stung. He \nmust have seen that on her face. “ No offense,” he said.  \n“None taken, ” she replied, unsure if  she meant it.  \n“It’s not that you ’re not attractive, it’ s just that you obviously love \nPatrice, and lucky him. ” \nShe was a little stunned. Others thought that she loved  Patrice. \nDid she? Really? She looked inside herself wondering if that was \nwhat she reall y felt, or was it just sympathy for his position?  \nHer silence unnerved him, and he continued speaking. “ Besides, ” \nhe said. “ There’ s only one person I ’ll ever love.”  \nHis words broke her out of her reverie, and curiosity took over. \n“Tell me about her.”  \n“We knew each other since we were this high,” he said, gesturing \nto his thigh. “ I think we loved each other before we knew what love \neven was.” \nHe smiled, a little sadly. Something turned in her stomach as she \nlooked into his eyes.  \n“Go on, ” she said, hoping s he wasn ’t hurting him.  \n“What can I say? We went through school together, and there \nwas never a day when we didn ’t see each other. As we got older, and \nwe realized how special our relationship was, we realized that it was this thing that poets and writers a nd singers spend so much time\n\nMessage:\nIs there a romantic relationship between them?\n"

Aisha appears to be exploring her feelings towards Patrice as revealed in her conversations with Soo-Kyung. Additionally, she finds herself frequently thinking about him and their future together. \n\nHowever, there is complexity to it. Aisha seems unsure about whether her feelings for Patrice are pure empathy due to his challenging past or if she is genuinely in love with him. It's also essential to consider that other characters, like the one in the last piece of context, have pointed out to Aisha that they perceive love between her and Patrice.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are strong indications of a romantic bond between Aisha and Patrice, it's unclear if both parties recognize or acknowledge this relationship as such.\n\nWould you like me to focus on how the bond develops and influences their characters in the talk?
