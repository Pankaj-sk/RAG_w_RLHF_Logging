    "content": "Context:\n\n1. While others, such as Soo -Kyung and Ronaldo, were extremely \neffective flyers that Aisha could never hope to match, she did seem \nto have a knack for strategy. Simms regula rly called upon her to \ncommand groups of flyers against ones that he set up.  \nAt first, his teams won easily. But, over time, she began to see \nhow he thought, and how he did  things. That was his weakness -- his \npredictability.  \nThe first time she beat him, i t was a tough slog and narrow \nvictory. After that, the wins came easier and easier, until he didn ’t \nseem to be much of a challenge anymore. \nHer sessions with Patrice were also extremely rewarding. Not \nonly was she learning a lot about self -defense, she als o found herself \ngrowing in confidence as she understood the art better. She \nremembered the first day that Soo -Kyung had shown her basic \nthrows, and how the smaller girl had held herself. Now she felt more \ncomfortable in her stance. \nShe hadn’ t yet dared go into the mess hall, but she knew the day \nwas coming soon.  \nPatrice became more and more interesting every moment she \nspent with him. He was certainly a very masculine guy, but not the \ncliché musclebound moron that she ’d known around her old school. 86 Laurence Moroney   \nIt went beyond intelligence, too --  there was something deeply \ninsightful about him. When he began to share his hopes and dreams \nfor the future with her, she realized that she wanted to spend the rest \nof her life with him.\n\n2. ***\nAs they left, she felt Soo -Kyung link her arm. There wasn ’t much to \nsay. They walked back to their apartment, and sat, sipping coffee as \nthe Earth rotated into view across the windows. \n“Three years, ” said Soo -Kyung.  \n“Three years,” repeated Aisha.  \nSoo-Kyung ’s intense gaze returned. “ We’re going to do this. \nWe’re going to succeed, and we’ re going to save them all. ” \n“Not all of them, ” said Aisha sadly. “ But as many as we can. ” \nThe Earth continued to rotate across her view. She saw the great \nfrozen north of Canada, and realized that Patrice was down there. \nSophie was down there.  \nI’m here she thought, and someday soon I will be down there with \nyou. We will be together, and we will build the world we dreamed of. \nWe will build a new future for man kind. A future in the stars.  \nShe reached her hand up and touched the glass, watching the \nEarth beneath.  \nI promise.\n\n3. And just like that Aisha embraced him. Held him close.  \n“We will, ” she said. “ We’ll do it together.”  \n***  \nShe didn ’t know if it was because of their sch edules, or because they \nwere afraid of cover being blown, but she and Soo -Kyung didn ’t see \nmuch of Patrice or Seamus for the next few days. Maybe it was a good thing -- there was just so much to take in. The school was \nhitting them hard with science, mostl y physics, and mostly practical.  \nNot for the first time, she wondered why they spent so much \ntime in labs, when they were up in space. Mister Stevens, their lab \nmaster, had them working on experiments in understanding inertia \nand the transfer of force. Ais ha swore that if she bounced one more \nmetal ball off another steel block to measure the transfer of energy, she’d scream.  \nIt was relief when, at the end of class, their form master \nentered. He was a tall man with a craggy face who only wanted to be called Simms.  \n“Today, Cadets, we have a little surprise for you. We’ re going to \nthe hub, where you ’re going to get your first taste of being a real \ncadet. So take off your lab coats and safety glasses, and rank up behind me! ”  Space Cadets  59 \nThey followed him, in rank, up ladders through section after \nsection as they approached the hub. With a giddy feeling, Aisha felt \nherself get lighter and lighter as the gravity reduced. Finally, they entered through a hatch into a wide, empty area.\n\n4. “I don ’t even know your name.”  \nHe smiled. “ You’re right. Patrice.”  \n“Isn’t that a girl ’s name? ” \nHe laughed. “ Not in Canada, apparently! ” \nShe liked his natural laugh. There was something so sincere and \nunguarded about it.  \n“So what do you want to talk about? ” \n“I have been here for almost six years,” he said. “ Almost since the \nbeginning. There were only two wheels then.”  \n“You must have been, what, eleven? ” \n“Ten, ” he said. “ But my parents thought it was best for me to \ncome here.”  \n“That’s rough. You must miss them. ” \n“I do, and I don ’t,” he said. “ I rarely saw them when I was Earth -\nside, as I was always carted off to various boarding schools. I think I \nmiss my sister most of all. ” \n“I’m sorry, that must be hard,” said Aisha, putting her hand on \nhis arm gently for a moment.  \n“I guess I ’m used to it, ” he said. “ That’s the life of a  rich kid. ” \nAisha nodded. “ You were one of the first ones here, so I figured \nyou must be. ” \n“Not just rich, ” said Patrice. “ My family is one of the richest in the \nworld. They funded much of the development of this place.”  \nShe resisted the impulse to say ‘ wow’, and instead defiantly \nburst out, “ Am I supposed to be impressed? ” \n“I’m glad you aren ’t,” he said. “ Money is a fleeting thing after all. ” 52 Laurence Moroney   \n“So why are you telling me this? ” \nHe sat on a small bench, and she joined him. There was a \nwindow in the floor in f ront of them, and they watched as the Earth\n\n5. There was only one thing she could do. It might be the end of \nher time in the school, but she wasn’ t going to let Sebastian hurt \nPatrice any more.  \nWith all her strength, she stabbed Sebastian in the back of the \nknee with the splintered end of the bo. \nHe screamed and broke his swing.  \nWith all her strength she twisted the bo. She felt it splinter \nfurther, and heard the sound of tendons ripping. Sebastian screamed \nand twisted around to see her. She saw the snarl of hate and pain on \nhis face. He tried to change his swing to hit her, but she twisted the \nbo again.  \n“No,” said Patrice. “ Aisha, don ’t” \nBut she did. Lifting the bo with all her strength, she pulled \nSebastian ’s leg from under him. He passed out from the pain before \nhe hit the ground.  \nShe looked ba ck at Patrice ’s eyes. She could see his pain. More \nthan the broken ribs. More than the blows he had received from \nSebastian.  \nIt’s what she had done. It ’s what she had gotten herself into.  \n“I’m so sorry, Patrice,” she said. “ I’m just so sorry. ” \nHis eyes rolled, and his skin went pale. “ Aisha, ” he said weakly.  \n“I’m sorry, Patrice. I never knew this would happen.”  \n“Aisha, ” he said again, but his eyes rolled again and he \npassed out.    \n \nCHAPTER 15  \nRecovery  \nAlways remember that the difference b etween an adult and a \nchild, or the difference between a human and an animal, is \none’s willingness to take responsibility.  \nBy that I mean that you need to own your situation. For good\n\nMessage:\nTell me about the relationship between Aisha and Patrice\n"
