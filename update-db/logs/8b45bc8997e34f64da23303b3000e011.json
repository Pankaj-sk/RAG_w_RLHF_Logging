She never thought \nshe’d find that kind of thing attractive, always thinking that she \nwanted a guy that would make her laugh. But whenever she looked \ninto his eyes when he was like this, she just wanted to get lost.  \nShe felt a tap on the top of her head from Soo -Kyung, \npresumably asking her to stop drooling.  \n“When do we start? ” \n“Tomorrow, ” said Patrice.  \n“Why not right now? ” \n“Because you ’ve taken a blow to the head. You should rest. ” \n“That’s no fun. ” \n“Learning to fight isn’ t fun either. ” \n“I thought I was learning to defend myself ,” she said, mimicking \nhis voice.  \nSeamus covered his mouth with his hand and snickered. “ She \ngot you there, Buddy!”  \nAisha laughed, covering her mouth, and trying not to cry again. \nShe remembered the despair that she had felt earlier in the day, the \ndesire to go home. \nAnd then she realized that home was here with these crazy \npeople. Soo -Kyung, a member of the North Korean elite; Seamus, an \nIrish hacker; and Patrice, the kind of person she always thought that \nshe would hate: Rich, white and privileged. But instead he was kind \nand warm and good. She looked at him and a warmth radiated from \nher heart.  \nIs this what they cal l love,  she wondered, before Soo -Kyung \ninsisted that the boys stay for dinner.    \n \nCHAPTER 13  \nFriendship  \nLove can be such a powerful force, and such a fickle feeling. \nBefore you ever find love, you will wonder what it is, and\n\n2. even enjoy them.  \nDavid hadn ’t spoken much since their walk on the lunar surface. \nHe almost seemed embarrassed around Aish a. Like a very private \nthought of his had surfaced, and he didn’ t want people to see him \n‘like that ’. She made a point of working closely with him, and \nreferring to him in conversations, but that seemed to put him in his \nshell all the more.  134 Laurence Moroney   \nTheir quarters  were tiny, barely bigger than the bunk bed and \nthe small shared bathroom. They looked more like a prison cell. But \nit was a refuge from outside, and Aisha was happy to be sharing \nwith Soo -Kyung again. She wanted solace more than anything, but \nSoo-Kyung ’s discretion was the next best thing.  \nHowever, discretion wasn ’t on her mind. As soon as they were \nalone, Soo -Kyung spoke up. “ What happened out there? David \nhasn ’t been the same since our walk on the surface this afternoon.”  \n“He shared something from his pa st,” Aisha said, trying to keep \nas neutral as possible. “ And I think he ’s a bit embarrassed about it. \nLike he doesn ’t know why he shared it, and he doesn’ t want me to \nknow what I know. ” \nSoo-Kyung sat on the bed. “ Is it bad? ” \n“It’s sad. But he did nothing wrong. He is angry though. ” \n“I can ’t ever see David being angry.” Soo-Kyung ’s eyebrows \nfurrowed. “It’s just so not him. One of the things I really like about \nhim is how calm and controlled he always is. ” \n“Don’t let Seamus hear you say that, ” Aisha teased.  \n“Seamus? ”\n\n3. Soo-Kyung was exasperated. “ Isn’t that what they  think they ’re \ndoing? Doesn ’t that just make us the same as them? ” \nSeamus interrupted with an external comm. “ Folks, Captain has \nordered you back double- time. ” \n“Why? ” \n“We’re going home.”  \n***  \nThey landed and proceeded to the pilots’ ready room. Seamus was \nwaiting for them there.  \nSoo-Kyung got straight down to business. “ What ’s going on? ” \n“They discovered more than just your lichens. More complex \nforms of life. Not much  more complex, mind you, just simple \norganisms. It got the brass scared though. They want us to head back to Earth  as soon as possible. ” \n“Scared? Why?”  \n“They wouldn’ t say, but it wouldn ’t be hard to guess. If there’ s \nlife here, there’ s life anywhere. Earth isn ’t prepared for that.”  \nBefore they could say anything, he continued. “ And I don ’t mean \ninternally. Look, we’ ve just proven that it’ s easy to jump between \nstars, and the first star we encounter has life. Therefore the Galaxy \nmust be teeming with life, and some of that has to be a threat. Earth, \nright now is wide open to a potential attack. ” \n“It’s not likely though, ” said Soo -Kyung. “Is it? I mean the path \nbetween the stars has been there for billions of years. Just because we  \njust discovered it, doesn ’t mean others haven ’t been using it for a \nlong time. ” \n“Agreed,” said Seamus, “ but that isn ’t how they  think. There ’s \nnow a clear and present danger. They want to ensure that we ’re\n\n4. “Wake up, ” said Soo -Kyung. “You’re a light year away.”  \n“Sorry,” said Aisha. “ I just don ’t know what to do. ” \n“Do what your heart tells you. ” \n“It tells me conflicting things. ” \n“Then sort them out, but keep your brain focused on your \nproper work.”  \nAs always Soo -Kyung was right. Annoyingly so. Aisha sighed. \nWhatever would she do?  \n***  \nI’m going to regret this,  she thought as she slipped out the apartment. \nSoo-Kyung was in the shower, so she could be at her dest ination \nbefore her friend suspected anything.  \nShe’d slip in the back and find a discrete spot just to watch . It \nshould be easy.  \nSure enough, the room was full, and the open space was divided \ninto four areas where students would match up against each other  \nusing the padded bos.  \nSebastian was nowhere to be seen. She felt a little vindicated,  \nThe concept was simple. Win, and you stay on the mat. Lose, \nand you go to the back of the challengers line. Some of the challengers 90 Laurence Moroney   \nwere hopelessly overmatched and barely lasted a few seconds \nagainst their attackers.  \nOne boy, David, was amazing. His speed was unmatched. Even \nPatrice would look slow up against him. He also exuded calm -- \nwatching his opponent, measuring them, and figuring out the \ncombination that would ta ke them down. He then executed \nflawlessly, taking them out of the fight effortlessly. His skills were\n\n5. him. Someone who leaves behind all that she is in a desire to be \nmore like him. It ’s a reaffirmation of his perceived superiority.”  \nAisha shook her head, and Soo -Kyung punched her gently on \nthe shoulder. “ Hold still or this wound will get worse. I ’m going to \ngive you some stitches now, okay? ” \nShe felt the cold spray of anesthetic on her scalp, as Soo -Kyung \ngot to work.  \n“I have some expertise in Martial arts, including the bo , which is \nvery popular amongst the older children,”  said Patrice.  \n“Bennett, ” said Seamus, “ is really good at it, too. ” \n“Not as good as me, ” said Patrice.  \n“I’m not going to let you fight him for me, ” said Aisha, defiantly.   Space Cadets  81 \nPatrice smiled his kind smile. “ I know, ” he said. “ But you are \ngoing to let me help you learn how to use it, so you can defend \nyourself against him in the future. ” \n“And I know a thing or two as well, ” said Soo -Kyung, as she put \nthe finishing touches on some liquid sutures. “ Wound is clean and \nstitched up. It’ ll likely sting for a while, but I don ’t think your brain \nleaked out. ” \n“So you ’re going to teach me t o fight? ” \n“I’m going to teach you to defend yourself , there’ s a difference.”  \nShe could see the seriousness in his eyes. She never thought \nshe’d find that kind of thing attractive, always thinking that she \nwanted a guy that would make her laugh. But whenever she looked \ninto his eyes when he was like this, she just wanted to get lost.\n\nMessage:\nTell me about Soo-Kyung and Seamus\n"
