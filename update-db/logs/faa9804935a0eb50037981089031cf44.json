He was one of the only ones that wasn’ t awkward around the \nIsraeli kid. He was quiet, but when he spoke he was very passionate. ” He laughed, recalling memories. “ I used to think he was \nan Israeli, too. ” \nHe looked into her eyes and she saw genuine feeling there. “ I’ll \nbe honest with you, ” he continued. “Patrice was somebody that we  Space Cadets  119 \nwere all a little shy around. While we all come from rich and \npowerful backgrounds, his family were head- and-shoulders above \nmost of ours. But he was humble, and while he never flaunted it, the fact that he is who he is made it  so that nobody could ever get close \nto him. We were all a little intimidated, I guess.”  \nShe remembered how she had felt when he had explained it to \nher. How she thought he might be condescending. “ I understand \nwhat you mean, ” she said finally.  \nHe nodded and smiled, bringing the coffee cup to his mouth one \nmore time, before putting it down without drinking. “ You should \ncome to Israel someday if you like this slop, ” he said. “ But it would \nruin you. You ’d never drink coffee again.”  \nShe laughed. “ I’ll take yo u up on that. ” \n“Hopefully he will come with you. ” \nShe smiled and blushed again. “ David, ” she said, quietly.  \n“Yes?” \n“Thank you. ” \n“For what? ” \n“For the last few weeks, when I think of him, I see him lying in \nthat hospital bed, wondering if he ’ll ever wake up.

Would you like to \njoin me for a coffee? ” \nDavid smiled, nodded and gestured to lead the way.  \nScattered around the tenth ring of the station were what the \nadults called ‘ Micro Kitchens ’, small areas with basic snac k food and \ndrinks. Many of those working on the various projects that were part \nof the program -- including the Phaeton fighter craft -- didn ’t have \ntime for full meals, so they’d grab a quick in a Micro Kitchen. \nDavid found one and gestured for Aisha to take a seat while he \nmade coffee. \nSoon, he brought it over, smelling it. “This coffee sucks, but it ’s \nthe best I could do. ” \nShe took a sip. “ Actually, ” she said. “ It’s not that  bad.” \n“That ’s because you ’re used to American coffee, and that \nreally  sucks. ” \n“So where are you from? ” \n“Israel.”  \n“Ah, so I should call you King David? ” \nHe shrugged and smiled. “ If you like. ” \n“I notice that a lot of the older kids, like yourself, don ’t wear flags \non their uniforms.
