That it had been sealed and \nencrypted so deeply that Seamus couldn ’t break it.  \n“Yet he was able to break mine? ” \n“Yes.” \n“Curious, ” Soo -Kyung said . \n“So what did he read? ” \n“Probably the cover story.”  \n“Cover story? ” Aisha asked . \n“I’m not exactly what I appear to be. ” \n“He said that nobody  here is exactly who they appear to be.”  \n“He is very wise,” she smiled a little. “ And cute. ” \nAisha wasn ’t going to let her change the subject. “Just who are \nyou, then? ” \n“According to the files, I ’m one of the children that were hand-\npicked by the regime in  my country to go through the best of \ntraining in everything. Science, technology, martial arts, languages, \npiloting, strategy…a list as long as your arm. ” \n“According to the files? ” \n“Yes. That was planted to explain how I can do the things I do, \nand to dis tract from the truth about who I am. ” \n“Who are you? ” \n“My name is Kim. ” \n“Yes. I know. It ’s a common name in Korea. ” \n“It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment. The family that had controlled the\n\n2. vertigo that those closer to the front would encounter. She picked one in the back row, next to an Asian girl who looked about Aisha ’s \nage. The girl was intensely reading a book on her tablet, and didn ’t \nlook up as Aisha sat.  \nShe suddenly spoke. “ Aisha Parks, celebrity. ” \nAisha looked at her. “ I’m not sure about that .” \nThe girl looked up, and her intense eyes searched Aisha ’s. “Good \nto know, ” she said finally, reaching a hand out. “ Soo-Kyung Kim, ” \nshe said.  \n“I don ’t need to tell you my name, I guess. ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled. Her plain face lit up when she smiled. She \nwas beautiful.  \n“So where are you from? ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled again. “You haven’ t heard of me? Good. I \nguess I am not a celebrity, either.”  \nSuch an odd an swer, and from Soo -Kyung ’s reaction, it was clear \nthat Aisha ’s confusion was written on her face.  26 Laurence Moroney  \n“I think we are going to be good friends, ” said Soo -Kyung. “I like how \nyou are straightforward. I am too, but that intimidates some people. ” \n“So where are you  from? ” \n“I am from a small village called Sijungho, ” continued Soo -\nKyung. “There’ s not much to see there.”  \n“Sounds Korean, ” said Aisha. “ You from South Korea? ” \n“North  Korea,” corrected Soo -Kyung. “I’ve never even been to \nSouth Korea. ” \nAisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a \nlittle, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat. Her father had \ndied as a result of radiation sickness incurred in the second Korean\n\n3. “It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment. The family that had controlled the \ncountry. That had brought it to war with the West. A war that had \nclaimed the life of her own father. She felt anger growing.  \n“I wasn ’t a part of  it,” said Soo -Kyung. “I am as much a victim as you. ” \nThe pit of Aisha ’s stomach went cold. That war had killed her \nfather. Soo -Kyung ’s family was responsible.  \n“You could judge me for what they did, ” she said. “ But you ’d be \nwrong to do so. You can ’t hold me guilty by association. ” \nAisha sighed. Anger wasn ’t right. She didn ’t want to blame Soo -\nKyung. Finally, she said, “ You sound just like Patrice. ” \n“Patrice? ” \n“Smith. ” \n“Oh. First -name terms now, huh? ” \nShe wasn ’t going to let Soo -Kyung change the topic. “ I don’t \nknow what to say. ” \n“Well, nobody else knows who I am. Only you. If you want to \nreport me, I am at your mercy.”  \n“But the files show you are someone else.”  \n“Files, which in your case, are locked. If you  were to report \nsomething it would probably be believed. They clearly hold you in high regard.”  \n“So, why? ” \n“Why what? ” \n“Why come up here? ” \nSoo-Kyung looked thoughtful for a moment, like she was \nsearching for the right words to say. “ For a new start. If I w ere to stay\n\n4. “North  Korea,” corrected Soo -Kyung. “I’ve never even been to \nSouth Korea. ” \nAisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a \nlittle, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat. Her father had \ndied as a result of radiation sickness incurred in the second Korean \nWar. And there was a North Korean girl here with h er. Going into \nspace with her.  \nShe knew there was incredulity in her voice, but she couldn ’t \nmask it. “ Are you going to the Academy too? ” \n“Yes,” said Soo -Kyung. “And don ’t worry, I ’m as surprised as \nyou are.”  \n“That’s what you meant by celebrity? ” \n“It seems  the media made as big a deal about me being the first \nNorth Korean as it did about you being the first African -American to \ngo through open enrollment. It ’s all a sham though, isn ’t it?” \n“I’m beginning to gather that. ” \n“I mean, when the Academy was first b uilt, it was apparent that \nit was for the Elites, most of whom are from Western society, with a \nfew Russians and Chinese thrown in to get funding. Nobody really \nknows who the students were, but it was typically those who would \nbe in private elite schools on the surface, so being in space made \nlittle difference.”  \nAisha thought about what Soo -Kyung was saying, and \nrealized that she was right. Amazing that she had never thought of this herself.  \nThe Korean girl continued. “Now that they are all in place and \nestablished, it ’s time to open it up to the rest of the world, so we can\n\n5. on his breast. “ We learn to fly? ” \n“Oh yes, ” said Porter. “ And a whole lot more besides! ” \nFor the whole trip Soo -Kyung walked no more than an arm’s \nlength from Aisha, but didn’ t say a word. She caugh t her friend’ s eye \nfrom time to time, but the Korean girl just gave a downward look \nthat almost appeared to be a bow. Aisha didn ’t push it.  \n***  \nClasses finished for the day, they returned to their quarters, \nexhausted. Smith was waiting at the door, with Seamus nowhere to \nbe seen. There was a flicker across Soo -Kyung ’s face that almost \nlooked like disappointment.   Space Cadets  51 \nSmith nodded to her, and she returned the gesture. “ Can we \ntalk,” he said to Aisha, “ alone? ” \nFor the first time that day, Aisha saw a small smile o n Soo -\nKyung ’s face. She nodded, and entered the apartment, leaving Aisha \nwith Smith.  \n“I’m sorry about last night, ” he said. “ I think we came across a bit \nstrong. I hope we didn ’t scare you. ” \n“It’s okay, ” said Aisha, realizing that she meant it, but also \ncurious about what had spooked Soo -Kyung. “But don ’t talk about \nSoo-Kyung, I want to talk with her directly. ” \n“Okay, ” he said. “ Walk? ” \n“I don ’t even know your name.”  \nHe smiled. “ You’re right. Patrice.”  \n“Isn’t that a girl ’s name? ” \nHe laughed. “ Not in Canada, apparently! ” \nShe liked his natural laugh. There was something so sincere and \nunguarded about it.  \n“So what do you want to talk about? ”\n\nMessage:\nTell me about Soo Kyung Kim\n"
