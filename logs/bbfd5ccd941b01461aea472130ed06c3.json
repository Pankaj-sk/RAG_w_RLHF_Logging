That it had been sealed and \nencrypted so deeply that Seamus couldn ’t break it.  \n“Yet he was able to break mine? ” \n“Yes.” \n“Curious, ” Soo -Kyung said . \n“So what did he read? ” \n“Probably the cover story.”  \n“Cover story? ” Aisha asked . \n“I’m not exactly what I appear to be. ” \n“He said that nobody  here is exactly who they appear to be.”  \n“He is very wise,” she smiled a little. “ And cute. ” \nAisha wasn ’t going to let her change the subject. “Just who are \nyou, then? ” \n“According to the files, I ’m one of the children that were hand-\npicked by the regime in  my country to go through the best of \ntraining in everything. Science, technology, martial arts, languages, \npiloting, strategy…a list as long as your arm. ” \n“According to the files? ” \n“Yes. That was planted to explain how I can do the things I do, \nand to dis tract from the truth about who I am. ” \n“Who are you? ” \n“My name is Kim. ” \n“Yes. I know. It ’s a common name in Korea. ” \n“It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment. The family that had controlled the\n\n2. vertigo that those closer to the front would encounter. She picked one in the back row, next to an Asian girl who looked about Aisha ’s \nage. The girl was intensely reading a book on her tablet, and didn ’t \nlook up as Aisha sat.  \nShe suddenly spoke. “ Aisha Parks, celebrity. ” \nAisha looked at her. “ I’m not sure about that .” \nThe girl looked up, and her intense eyes searched Aisha ’s. “Good \nto know, ” she said finally, reaching a hand out. “ Soo-Kyung Kim, ” \nshe said.  \n“I don ’t need to tell you my name, I guess. ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled. Her plain face lit up when she smiled. She \nwas beautiful.  \n“So where are you from? ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled again. “You haven’ t heard of me? Good. I \nguess I am not a celebrity, either.”  \nSuch an odd an swer, and from Soo -Kyung ’s reaction, it was clear \nthat Aisha ’s confusion was written on her face.  26 Laurence Moroney  \n“I think we are going to be good friends, ” said Soo -Kyung. “I like how \nyou are straightforward. I am too, but that intimidates some people. ” \n“So where are you  from? ” \n“I am from a small village called Sijungho, ” continued Soo -\nKyung. “There’ s not much to see there.”  \n“Sounds Korean, ” said Aisha. “ You from South Korea? ” \n“North  Korea,” corrected Soo -Kyung. “I’ve never even been to \nSouth Korea. ” \nAisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a \nlittle, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat. Her father had \ndied as a result of radiation sickness incurred in the second Korean\n\n3. “It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment. The family that had controlled the \ncountry. That had brought it to war with the West. A war that had \nclaimed the life of her own father. She felt anger growing.  \n“I wasn ’t a part of  it,” said Soo -Kyung. “I am as much a victim as you. ” \nThe pit of Aisha ’s stomach went cold. That war had killed her \nfather. Soo -Kyung ’s family was responsible.  \n“You could judge me for what they did, ” she said. “ But you ’d be \nwrong to do so. You can ’t hold me guilty by association. ” \nAisha sighed. Anger wasn ’t right. She didn ’t want to blame Soo -\nKyung. Finally, she said, “ You sound just like Patrice. ” \n“Patrice? ” \n“Smith. ” \n“Oh. First -name terms now, huh? ” \nShe wasn ’t going to let Soo -Kyung change the topic. “ I don’t \nknow what to say. ” \n“Well, nobody else knows who I am. Only you. If you want to \nreport me, I am at your mercy.”  \n“But the files show you are someone else.”  \n“Files, which in your case, are locked. If you  were to report \nsomething it would probably be believed. They clearly hold you in high regard.”  \n“So, why? ” \n“Why what? ” \n“Why come up here? ” \nSoo-Kyung looked thoughtful for a moment, like she was \nsearching for the right words to say. “ For a new start. If I w ere to stay\n\n4. “Wake up, ” said Soo -Kyung. “You’re a light year away.”  \n“Sorry,” said Aisha. “ I just don ’t know what to do. ” \n“Do what your heart tells you. ” \n“It tells me conflicting things. ” \n“Then sort them out, but keep your brain focused on your \nproper work.”  \nAs always Soo -Kyung was right. Annoyingly so. Aisha sighed. \nWhatever would she do?  \n***  \nI’m going to regret this,  she thought as she slipped out the apartment. \nSoo-Kyung was in the shower, so she could be at her dest ination \nbefore her friend suspected anything.  \nShe’d slip in the back and find a discrete spot just to watch . It \nshould be easy.  \nSure enough, the room was full, and the open space was divided \ninto four areas where students would match up against each other  \nusing the padded bos.  \nSebastian was nowhere to be seen. She felt a little vindicated,  \nThe concept was simple. Win, and you stay on the mat. Lose, \nand you go to the back of the challengers line. Some of the challengers 90 Laurence Moroney   \nwere hopelessly overmatched and barely lasted a few seconds \nagainst their attackers.  \nOne boy, David, was amazing. His speed was unmatched. Even \nPatrice would look slow up against him. He also exuded calm -- \nwatching his opponent, measuring them, and figuring out the \ncombination that would ta ke them down. He then executed \nflawlessly, taking them out of the fight effortlessly. His skills were\n\n5. “North  Korea,” corrected Soo -Kyung. “I’ve never even been to \nSouth Korea. ” \nAisha felt her insides go cold.

And there was a North Korean girl here with h er. Going into \nspace with her.  \nShe knew there was incredulity in her voice, but she couldn ’t \nmask it. “ Are you going to the Academy too? ” \n“Yes,” said Soo -Kyung. “And don ’t worry, I ’m as surprised as \nyou are.”  \n“That’s what you meant by celebrity? ” \n“It seems  the media made as big a deal about me being the first \nNorth Korean as it did about you being the first African -American to \ngo through open enrollment. It ’s all a sham though, isn ’t it?” \n“I’m beginning to gather that. ” \n“I mean, when the Academy was first b uilt, it was apparent that \nit was for the Elites, most of whom are from Western society, with a \nfew Russians and Chinese thrown in to get funding.

Amazing that she had never thought of this herself.  \nThe Korean girl continued. “Now that they are all in place and \nestablished, it ’s time to open it up to the rest of the world, so we can\n\nMessage:\nTell me about Soo Kyung Kim\n"

    "content": "Let's start with what we know about Soo-Kyung Kim. She is a person of Korean heritage, specifically from North Korea. She is an extraordinarily well-trained individual from an early age, with an impressive set of skills. She has been educated in science, technology, languages, strategy, piloting, and even martial arts - an educational investment that requires substantial resources. This is perhaps the first unusual detail about Soo-Kyung. Most children, even those fortunate enough to receive education, don't enjoy such comprehensive training.\n\nFrom what we've gathered, Soo-Kyung's lineage traces back to the family that has controlled the Democratic People's Republic of Korea since its founding. That makes her a scion of the ruling elite, a fact that puts her in a position of unusual privilege, but also paints a target on her.\n\nHowever, despite her lineage, Soo-Kyung represents herself as a victim of the same oppressive regime that her family governs. She denies any involvement in the actions of her family that led to war and conflict. Yet her involvement cannot be easily dismissed given the extensive resources that were clearly invested in her personal development.\n\nSoo-Kyung has left her home, seeking a new start and is at the mercy of those who know her true identity. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect about Soo-Kyung is her motivation. Why would a young woman trained to perfection, given every advantage, and positioned for a life of influence and control in her homeland, choose to leave it all behind and venture into the unknown?\n\nTo bring her character to life during the talk, a detailed focus is needed on these key themes: her extensive training, her lineage, her status as a victim or a benefactor of a problematic regime, and her decision to seek a new beginning. This will help the audience to grasp the complex personality that is Soo-Kyung Kim, the enigmatic and multi-talented individual who defies expectations at every turn.",
