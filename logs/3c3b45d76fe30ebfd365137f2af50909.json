    "content": "Context:\n\n1. Aisha looked at her hand for a long moment before holding it in \nhers and shaking it. “ Friends, ” she nodded, first smiling, then \ngrinning, and finally embracing the Korean girl in a giant hug.  \nShe surprised even herself at the warmth of her feelings, and \nknowing that she really meant them.    \n \nCHAPTER 11  \nBully  \nWherever you are, and whomever you are, there are people \nwho will, for whatever reason, try to put you down and make life difficult for you. There are many ways to deal with people like this, but there ’s only one truth: You never start the fight, \nbut you always finish it.  \nNo matter the cost … \n \nIT HAD BEEN A LONG  and difficult morning, and Aisha was tired \nand hungry as she entered the mess hall. The doorway was partially \nblocked with other enrollee students.  \nEnrollee was the official name to students like herself who had \ncome through open enrollment, but the  other students had far less \nkind words to describe them. Everything from rabble  to scum  to \nmeteors had been muttered near her. The first two were obvious, the \nthird she had no idea.  \n“When they throw us out the airlock, we’ ll burn up in the \natmosphere as m eteors,” Soo-Kyung had explained one night, \nseemingly unbothered by the implicit threat.  \n“Shouldn’ t we talk to the authorities, ” Aisha had asked. “ They \ncan’t do that, can they? ” \nSoo-Kyung shook her head. “ This isn ’t a public school. It ’s an \nacademy, a mil itary academy. If you do that, the teachers will think\n\n2. seemingly unbothered by the implicit threat.  \n“Shouldn’ t we talk to the authorities, ” Aisha had asked. “ They \ncan’t do that, can they? ” \nSoo-Kyung shook her head. “ This isn ’t a public school. It ’s an \nacademy, a mil itary academy. If you do that, the teachers will think \nyou’re soft. And worse , the other kids will think you ’re soft and  a \nsnitch. We ’ll have to deal with this ourselves. ” 72 Laurence Moroney   \n“How? ” \n“There’ s only one way, ” she replied. “Earn  their respect. Sooner \nor later they ’ll have to depend on us, and they know it. The sooner \nwe make them respect us, the sooner all this ends.”  \nThose words echoed in Aisha ’s mind as she worked her way \nthrough the crowd into the mess hall. Then she saw the issue. The \nolder kids had spread themselves across all the tables, leaving no room for Aisha ’s peers.  \nThe new kids looked at each other, unsure of what to do. As \nAisha entered, they looked to her too. Soo -Kyung had gone straight \nback to the apartment to get some sleep. \nEarn their respect , she had said. Stand up to a bully and smack him in \nthe mouth,  she had always learned. The closest table had only two \nstudents -- the English boy she had recognized from the launch, and \na short Asian girl who also bore a British flag. The name Lim  was \nemb roidered beneath.  \nWithout a word, Aisha grabbed her food and sat at the table.  “Space is taken, ” said the boy. His nameplate bore the name “ Bennett. ” \n“Which ones? ” \n“All of them. ”\n\n3. And just like that Aisha embraced him. Held him close.  \n“We will, ” she said. “ We’ll do it together.”  \n***  \nShe didn ’t know if it was because of their sch edules, or because they \nwere afraid of cover being blown, but she and Soo -Kyung didn ’t see \nmuch of Patrice or Seamus for the next few days. Maybe it was a good thing -- there was just so much to take in. The school was \nhitting them hard with science, mostl y physics, and mostly practical.  \nNot for the first time, she wondered why they spent so much \ntime in labs, when they were up in space. Mister Stevens, their lab \nmaster, had them working on experiments in understanding inertia \nand the transfer of force. Ais ha swore that if she bounced one more \nmetal ball off another steel block to measure the transfer of energy, she’d scream.  \nIt was relief when, at the end of class, their form master \nentered. He was a tall man with a craggy face who only wanted to be called Simms.  \n“Today, Cadets, we have a little surprise for you. We’ re going to \nthe hub, where you ’re going to get your first taste of being a real \ncadet. So take off your lab coats and safety glasses, and rank up behind me! ”  Space Cadets  59 \nThey followed him, in rank, up ladders through section after \nsection as they approached the hub. With a giddy feeling, Aisha felt \nherself get lighter and lighter as the gravity reduced. Finally, they entered through a hatch into a wide, empty area.\n\n4. it had felt like there was a tension building between them. Mother’ s \nbasking in her status had gotten under Aisha ’s skin, and she had \nbeen worried that she might blow up at her before leaving. She was \nworried that she might end up regretting it, but there was only so \nlong she could bite her tongue. \nShe almost thanked the reporter for his rude question. It had \nbrought the m closer together. She felt a pang of pride again at Mother ’s \nwords that she had done exactly what Father would have done.  \nOf course, the same reporter had wrestled his way to the front of \nthe audience, and was barking out questions to the cadets as they \nboarded the shuttle. She was happy she knew where he was, so she \ncould actively ignore him as she passed.  \nShe gave Mother one final hug, and turned and walked along \nthe long ramp up to the shuttle. With every step away from her, Aisha felt more and more alone. As the entrance loomed toward her, \nshe felt the urge to turn and run back to Mother ’s welcoming arms. \nMother would hold her and protect her, and to heck with anyone who would criticize her for not going through with it. But she didn ’t. \nShe continued s tep-by-step. At the top of the ramp, she turned for \none more look back at the Earth. She caught Mother ’s eye as she \nwaved frantically, blowing kisses and smiling. “ That’s my little girl! ”  \nShe raised her hand to wave, hearing cameras popping, and \nreturned the smile before turning to enter the shuttle. Her feet\n\n5. all intents and purposes, it was one. Their hotel was the finest Aisha had ever slept in, with big, comfortable beds and a wonderful \nbreakfast. The slight rocking of their room caused by t he waves only \nfurther lulled her to sleep.  \nSo it was in fine cheer that she greeted the press conference, the \ncrankiness of travel a distant memory. \nBefore long, she was biting her lip, trying not to snap at the \nmonotony and repetition of the questions that were largely \nirrelevant to her future as a space cadet.  \n“What ’s it like being the first African -American to qualify \nthrough open enrollment? ”  \n“It’s great, but I can ’t really answer what it ’s like until I go up there. \nBut I ’m looking forward to it, and hoping I can be an effective student. ” She watched as the reporters took notes, unhappy with such a \nstraightforward statement. There was no story  there.  \n“How do you think you are going to cope with the pressure? ” \n“Until I know what the pressure is, it ’s hard to answer that \nquestion. I ’m sure I will handle it the same way as any other student. ” \nOne of the reporters, a white man whose hair was whiter than his \nskin, interrupted. “ But you aren ’t like the other students, are you? ” \n“Why would you say that? ” \n“Because you are the first African -American student to qualify \nthrough open enrollment. ” \nAisha could feel her anger rising. She tried to keep her calm as \nshe answered evenly, “ How does that make me different from the \nother students? ”\n\nMessage:\ntell me about the relationship between Aisha and her teachers\n"

    "content": "From the context you provided, it seems Aisha has a respectful, yet challenging relationship with her teachers. They appear to push her and her peers quite hard in their studies, particularly in scientific subjects. They maintain a strict and formal atmosphere, as suggested by the teacher who only wanted to be referred to by his last name, Simms. \n\nNevertheless, there's a reciprocal respect present, as demonstrated by Aisha and her classmates diligently following their master's instruction and accompanying him towards the hub. It isn't a relationship of close familiarity, nor does it appear hostile. It seems to be one of mutual respect and discipline, expected in a military school setting.\n\nThe relationship between Aisha and her teachers within this military academy seems to foster growth and resilience. Her teachers, from what we can infer, visit toughness upon their students in preparation for the rigors they'll face as cadets.\n\nFor preparing your talk, you could discuss how this kind of a relationship in an education setting, although challenging, encourages growth, resilience, and the ability to thrive under pressure. You can discuss the benefits and potential issues of such an approach, and how it contrasts with traditional education methods. \n\nIs that the kind of direction you'd like to take for your talk?",

Then, climbing up to one of the inner sections, she was \nguided to his office.  \nIt was spartan and functional.

He \nsmiled slightly.  \n“At ease, Cadet.”  \nShe relaxed a little.  \n“Do you know why I called you here? ” \n“Sir, no, Sir.”  \n“Yes you do. ” \n“Sir, I can only speculate, Sir.”  \n“Then speculate.”  \n“Sir, it ’s about the incident in the dojo, Sir. ” \n“You speculate correctly. Do you know what you did to that boy? ” \n“Sir, do you know what he did to David? To Patrice? To me? I \nwas only defending myself, Sir. ”\n\n2. “What can I say? We went through school together, and there \nwas never a day when we didn ’t see each other. As we got older, and \nwe realized how special our relationship was, we realized that it was this thing that poets and writers a nd singers spend so much time \ndescribing. Yet none of them captured the true feelings that we had. \nNone of them could put a frame around what love actually is. ” \nHe stopped, and sat on a flattened boulder. “And then the Caliphate attacked Israel. She was on  a bus \nheaded back from school. I was at a meeting at my father ’s company, \nwhere they were telling us about the Academy, and my father was \npushing for them to take me. The first bombs fell, and the only \nmercy was that she was killed instantly. She didn ’t suffer.”  132 Laurence Moroney   \n“I’m sorry, ” was all she could muster. It didn ’t feel like \nnearly enough.  \n“I didn ’t want to come to the academy, ” he said. “ I didn ’t want to \nleave her, and there was no place for her here. My parents told me \nthat it was God ’s will for me to come. T hat everything, no matter \nhow tragic, was for His perfect will.”  \nShe put her hand on his shoulder, and even though they both \nwore thick padded spacesuits, she could feel him trembling. \n“So I came, ” he said. “ More to get away from them  than anything. \nThen I  learned about this program, and how we can go to the stars. I \nwant to go out there. And every day I ’m going to look for their so -\ncalled God, and his so -called Heaven.”\n\n3. understand them and take them to heart.  \nDon’t obey these words because I wrote them.

They ’re all whiter than I am.”  \n“But, surely, it ’s an international station, sanctioned by the UN? ” \n“Sanctioned  by them, but not paid for  by them, ” said Higgins. “ But \nyou’re asking the wrong questions. ”  Space Cadets  103 \nShe stopped for a moment. What did he mean by ‘ The wrong \nquestions ’? She looked at both men again. Their eyes were piercing \ninto hers, but it wasn ’t quite an interrogative thing. There was almost \naffection in them.

Why\n\n4. “Why would you say that? ” \n“Because you are the first African -American student to qualify \nthrough open enrollment. ” \nAisha could feel her anger rising. She tried to keep her calm as \nshe answered evenly, “ How does that make me different from the \nother students? ” \n“Please, ” said the man . “We all see how politically correct  this \nsituation is. There has been so much pressure on the board of \ngovernors to open enroll from amongst the general population so \nthat we can meet political needs of diversity. So, of course, the first \nthing we need t o do is to have some African -Americans amongst the \nstudent body. And while we ’re at it, why don ’t we get a girl , so we \nkill two proverbial birds with one proverbial stone. Let ’s also find \none who lost a father in the second Korean War! Isn ’t it obvious to \nyou that you have been picked for all of these reasons and that you are going into orbit to be in a place where you are likely to be out of \nyour depth, but will probably be handled by kid gloves, so as to \nsatisfy those who are bearing political pressures? ” \nAisha felt her jaw drop. Even Mother was stunned into silence. \nThe worst part, though, was that in a room full of people, many of \nwhom were African -American, nobody leapt to her defense. Instead \nthe press turned to her, recorders pointed in her direction, awaiting \nher answer.  \nWhat a bunch of sharks!  \nShe could feel herself begin to sweat as all eyes turned her way.\n\n5.

And then it was like he was still alive in \na way. Like his death didn ’t sting so bad. He was still gone, she still \nmissed him. But when his name lived on, he was more alive. I hope that makes sense. ” \nHe sipped the coffee thoughtfully and didn ’t squirm.  \n“Eliana, ” he said quietly. “ Her name was Eliana. ” \n“It’s beautiful. ” \n“Thanks. It means ‘ My God has answered me. ’” \n“And did he? ” \n“Did he what? ” \n“Answer her, by letting you be in her entire life.”  \nHe sat quietly, unable to answer. She saw tears welling in his \neyes. She rested her hand on his, and he didn ’t pull away.  \n“I know her life was short, and was cut short unjustly. But it \nsounds like she was happy for her entire life. She had something in \nyou that many of us search our whole life for and never find. Maybe \nher God answered her.”  \nHe looked up at Aisha, and a tear spilled down his cheek. \n“I’m sorry, ” she said. “ I didn ’t mean to. ” \n“You’re right,” he replied, wiping the tear away, and drinking \nmore of the coffee. “ I never looked at it that way. ” \nHe finished the coffee cup. “ Weird, ” he said. “ It doesn ’t taste so \nbad now. ” His mischievous look returned. “ Maybe I was drinking\n\n3. “I don ’t even know your name.”  \nHe smiled. “ You’re right.

He knew the men running the military academy and had left a letter with them for Aisha. He had high hopes for his daughter and foresaw her having a role in this specialized school, with the aim of giving civilization a new face among the stars. He was a visionary with a significant part in the early formation of the school.\n\nRoman Parks passed away while Aisha was just a few weeks old, and she only managed to know about him from stories she heard. Nonetheless, his influence had a profound effect on her. The strength, smartness, and independence that Aisha possesses is recognized as a trait she inherited from her father. This admiration of her father's qualities made him a significant figure in her life, despite his physical absence.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the context does not reveal the circumstances surrounding Roman's death or more about his day-to-day personality, only his wishes for Aisha and his role before she was born.",
